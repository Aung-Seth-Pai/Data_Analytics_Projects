### My Report based on the Visual
"The visualization was made to display how male and female of different age in the total population comprises in different employment categories. The bars on each side show the percentage of the employed population for male and female respectively with colours indicating the type of employment. Since the entire X-axis values indicate the percentage of the total population, the white space between the opposing bars shows the unemployed percentage for each age group. The data comes from 2019 Inter-number of number ofCensal Survey dataset available on the Ministry of Labour, Immigration and Population's public website (www.dop.gov.mm/en).

The distribution of the employed population is somewhat similar for both genders. However, in general, males have a slightly higher employment rate compared to female. From the visual, it can be seen that males employment rate is also higher for every employment type except for government employment. The most significant employment for each gender is "Self Employment", followed by "Private" employees. Very few percentages of the population engage in government employment, paid internships and as employers with regular employees. The lowest among them is the "Others" employment category which is not even visible in the graphic. To view the actual number of employed population for each employment type, click on the legend texts on Jupyter notebook's interactive environment." (Pai, 2021)
